When we create the one-connected test patterns... should we modify the pre-existent
0-connected one (like the article says) or we can generate new dots...
In the first case we need to store the values and take them, in the second maybe we
may not save them.

Paper ref
by modifying
each zero-connected pattern in such a way that one of the lines was
randomly selected, erased, and replaced by another line drawn to connect
two randomly selected dots.
