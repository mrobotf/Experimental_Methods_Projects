1) Dots generation
    - cant overlap each other
    - min 42px apart
    - Dots must be ≥10 pixels from boundaries


2) Lines generation
    - cant cross each other
    - cant touch the dots (Lines must be ≥12 pixels from any dot (except when connecting))
    - lines must not extend beyond boundaries
    - Connected lines must be 30-60 pixels long


3) Patterns generation
    - two random configuration (8 in total) cant be the same, must differ
    - when generating 1-connected and 2-connected patterns we need to be sure
      to re-use the exactly 0-connected configuration and we need to mirror it


4) LINE-DOT geometry
    - Drawing lines that connect exactly to dot centers while maintaining the 30-60 pixel length constraint
    - Finding pairs of dots within the right distance range
    - Ensuring the connecting line doesn't violate other constraints (like go on a dot, this seems complicate to implement)
    - check if we actually implement the "replace free line with connecting line procedure"


5) Timing
    - Ensuring stimuli are pre-loaded to avoid rendering delays (as we saw in week3/4?)
    - check monitor refersh and those things


7) Counterbalancing
    - use techniques explained in week 6
