## Numerosity Judgment: Estimating and Comparing

**Numerosity judgment** is when a person tries to estimate or compare how many items (like dots) are in a visual display—**without counting them one by one**

### Two Types of Numerosity Tasks

| Task | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Numerosity Comparison** | You must decide **which group has more dots**. You will see two groups of dots for a short time (so you can’t count) to compare.  | You see 12 dots and 18 dots—you quickly say, “The second one has more”. |
| **Numerosity Estimation** | Estimate how many dots are in the group. You will see **one group of dots**, briefly, and estimate the number of the dots based on a quick impression, not counting. |


## What Other Researchers Found (Introduction)

### 1. A Power Function for Estimation

* Indow & Ida (1977) and Krueger (1972, 1984) found that the way people perceive the number of dots follows a power function:
    $$\text{Perceived numerosity} = k \times (\text{Actual number})^{0.85}$$
    where $0.85$ is the **exponent** found by the researchers.
* -> People underestimate large numbers. When there are more dots, the increase in the perceived number feels slower than the real increase.

### 2. & 3. The Effect of Dot Size

| Task Type | Finding | Explanation | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Discrimination** (i.e. comparisons) | Dot size **doesn't affect discrimination**. Your ability to compare which set has more does not depend on dot size. | | (Allik et al., 1991)  |
| **Estimation** | Dot size matters. Larger dots lead to underestimation of the total number. | Larger dots make the display look “fuller,” causing the brain to think there are **fewer separate items**. | (Ginsburg & Nicholls, 1988) |

### 4. Two Sources for Errors in Discrimination
(Burgess & Barlow, 1983)

* **Randomness** (external variance) of dots-per-unit area in the dot patterns
* **Internal noise (observer variance)** generated by the observer: Small fluctuations in a person’s attention or perception cause errors in judgment.

### 5. Spatial Configuration influence

#### Finding: Arrangement Affects Perception

(Allik & Tuulmets, 1991; Ginsburg, 1978; Ginsburg & Goldstein, 1987).

| Dot Arrangement | How People Perceive It |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Regular arrangement** (e.g., in concentric circles) |tend to **overestimate**. |
| **Clustered pattern** | tend to **underestimate** |
| **Random pattern** | baseline |

Stable in both adults and children (ages $\sim 5.8-14.6$) (Ginsburg & Deluco, 1979).

#### Explanation: "Occupancy Model"
 
(Allik & Tuulmets, 1991)

Perceived numerosity depended on the subjective area covered by the totality of dots in a dot pattern; the impact of each dot was postulated to have some local spatial spread into its immediate neighborhood

The brain estimates number based on **how much total space the dots are taking up**, not on counting individual dots.

* Each dot supposedly occupied a circular territory of a fixed radius larger than its physical size
* so when two dots were close to one another, there was an overlap in their individual territory
* such that the total effective region covered by the dots was smaller than it would have been if the two dots had been more widely separated.

When the **occupied area decreases**, the **estimation decreases** (underestimation).

### 6. Nonspatial Factors – Structural Factors (Dot Connectedness)

(Koesling, Carbone, Pomplun, Sichelschmidt, and Ritter, 2004)

How connecting dots affects numerosity perception.

#### The Finding: Connection Causes Underestimation

* When dots were connected to form the shape of a closed polygon, they appeared much less numerous.
* Merely connecting dots to form polygons will result in **underestimation**.
* Forming an enclosed figure is not a necessary condition for this underestimation.

**Problems:** a method that is used **without restriction** to their viewing time, which led to participants performed patch-by-patch comparisons, instead of forming **an instantaneous impression** of dot numerosity (Koesling, Pomplun, & Ritter, 1998)
- This raised questions about whether the judgment was truly perceptual or cognitive. 
- Experiment 1 addressed this by using a brief display time.

## About this paper

### Method and Contribution of Experiment 1

**Question:** Is it the dot connection per se that mediates the underestimation effect?

**Methods:** To manipulate the number of connecting lines in test patterns while controlling for the total number of lines.

* briefly presented ($\sim 200 \text{ ms}$) so that the judgment was based on an **instantaneous impression without counting**.

* **Experiment 1 Results:** As the number of connected pairs increased, participants underestimate the number of the dots (in test patterns).

| Type of Contribution | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Empirical** | It shows that connecting dots causes people to **underestimate numerosity** |
| **Methodological** | The effect is **perceptual, not cognitive** (not due to counting/attention), confirmed by the brief display time (200 ms) |
| **Conceptual** | It supports **configural processing** (perception treats connected elements as unified wholes) and **topological theories** (Chen’s theory that connectedness is a fundamental property visual object perception). This suggests the visual system **groups connected dots into single “objects,”** so people see fewer separate items. |

<!-- This was measured using the **Point of Subjective Equality (PSE)**. The PSE values **increased** as connectedness increased, meaning it took **more** dots in the connected pattern to look equal to the unconnected reference—this proves the **underestimation** effect. -->
