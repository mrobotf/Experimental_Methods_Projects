# EXPERIMENT 1: DETAILED EXPLANATION
# Connectedness Affects Dot Numerosity Judgment

## OVERVIEW

**Research Question:** Does connecting dots with lines affect how many dots we perceive?

**Hypothesis:** When dots are connected by lines, they form unified perceptual objects, 
leading to underestimation of the total number of dots.

**Prediction:** More connections → Greater underestimation

---

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN

### Comparison Task
Participants view TWO dot patterns simultaneously (200ms flash) and decide which has more dots.

### Two Types of Patterns

**REFERENCE Pattern (Baseline):**
- Always 12 dots
- 4 freely hanging lines (not touching dots)
- 0 connections
- Stays constant throughout experiment

**TEST Pattern (Manipulated):**
- Variable number of dots: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
- 4 lines total
- Variable connections: 0, 1, or 2 pairs of dots connected
- Changes across trials

### Key Manipulation: CONNECTEDNESS

The critical manipulation is how many pairs of dots are connected by lines:

**Zero-connected:**
- All 4 lines hang freely (don't touch any dots)
- Baseline condition - like the reference pattern

**One-connected:**
- 1 line connects two dots
- 3 lines hang freely
- Still 4 total lines

**Two-connected:**
- 2 lines each connect two dots (4 dots involved)
- 2 lines hang freely
- Still 4 total lines

**Important:** Total number of lines is ALWAYS 4 in all patterns. This controls for 
visual clutter - any effect must be due to CONNECTION, not just presence of lines.

## CONDITIONS

**Independent Variables:**
1. Connectedness level: 0, 1, or 2 pairs connected
2. Number of dots in test: 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

**Total Conditions:** 3 × 7 = 21 conditions

**Repetitions:** 8 different spatial configurations per condition

**Total unique test patterns:** 21 conditions × 8 reps = 168 patterns

---

## TRIAL STRUCTURE

Each trial follows this sequence:

1. **Fixation cross** (green, center screen)
   - Participant maintains fixation

2. **Random delay** (500-1000ms)
   - Prevents anticipation

3. **STIMULUS PRESENTATION** (200ms) ← CRITICAL
   - Both patterns flash SIMULTANEOUSLY
   - One on left, one on right side of screen
   - Too brief to count dots one-by-one
   - Left/right position randomized

4. **Blank screen**
   - Remains until response

5. **Response**
   - Press LEFT arrow if left has more dots
   - Press RIGHT arrow if right has more dots
   - NO TIME LIMIT
   - NO FEEDBACK given

---

## SESSION STRUCTURE

### Practice Phase
- 30 practice trials
- Easy discrimination: 9 vs 12 dots
- Familiarizes participants with task

### Main Experiment
**5 Blocks** of trials, each containing:
- **First half:** 168 trials
  - All 21 conditions × 8 repetitions
  - Completely randomized order
  - Test/reference positions randomized

- **Second half:** 168 trials
  - Exact same trials as first half
  - BUT positions reversed (left ↔ right)
  - This counterbalances any spatial biases

**Total per block:** 336 trials  
**Total experiment:** 5 blocks × 336 = 1,680 trials per participant

**Duration:** Approximately 1 hour

**Rest periods:** Brief breaks between blocks

## PARTICIPANTS

- 4 university students
- Paid participants
- All naive to the purpose of the experiment
- No prior participation in similar experiments

---

## DATA COLLECTION

For each trial, record:
- Number of dots in test pattern
- Connectedness level (0, 1, or 2)
- Number of dots in reference (always 12)
- Which side participant chose (left or right)
- Response time
- Whether test was on left or right
- Block number
- Trial number

---

## DATA ANALYSIS

### Step 1: Calculate Proportions
For each condition (e.g., "13 dots, one-connected"):
- Count how many times participant said "test has more" 
- Divide by total trials for that condition (80 trials)
- This gives proportion "test judged as more"

### Step 2: Create Psychometric Functions
For each connectedness level (0, 1, 2):
- Plot proportion "test has more" against number of test dots
- X-axis: Number of dots in test (9-15)
- Y-axis: Proportion of "test has more" responses (0-1)

### Step 3: Fit Curves
Fit a cumulative Gaussian function to the data points:
- This creates a smooth S-shaped curve
- Uses maximum likelihood method (Psignifit toolbox)

### Step 4: Extract PSE
**PSE = Point of Subjective Equality**
- The number of test dots where participant says "left has more" and 
  "right has more" equally often (50% threshold)
- Represents the number of test dots that LOOKS equal to 12 reference dots

---

## EXPECTED RESULTS

### Predicted Pattern

**Zero-connected condition:**
- PSE ≈ 11.9 dots
- Nearly accurate perception

**One-connected condition:**
- PSE ≈ 12.6 dots
- Slight rightward shift

**Two-connected condition:**
- PSE ≈ 13.5 dots
- Large rightward shift

### Interpretation

**Rightward shift in psychometric curve = Higher PSE = Underestimation**

If PSE = 13.5 for two-connected patterns, this means:
- A pattern with 13.5 connected dots LOOKS like it has only 12 dots
- Participant needs 13.5 actual dots to perceive "equal to 12"
- This is ~1.5 dots underestimation

**Key Finding:**
The more connections, the higher the PSE, the greater the underestimation.

This supports the hypothesis that connected dots are perceptually grouped 
into unified objects, reducing the perceived number of distinct items.

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

### Theoretical Implications

1. **Perceptual Grouping:** Connectedness causes dots to be grouped together

2. **Object Formation:** Connected elements form single perceptual units

3. **Numerosity Processing:** We count OBJECTS, not individual elements

4. **Configural Processing:** Visual system processes configurations, 
   not just raw features

### Key Insight

This experiment shows that numerosity perception is not just about 
counting individual items - it's fundamentally affected by how those 
items are organized and connected in space.

The visual system automatically groups connected elements into unified 
objects BEFORE numerosity estimation occurs.

## CONTROL FEATURES

What makes this a good experiment:

1. **Brief presentation (200ms):** Prevents counting
2. **Constant total lines (4):** Controls for visual clutter
3. **Large sample (80 trials/condition):** Good statistical power
4. **Counterbalanced positions:** Eliminates spatial biases
5. **Multiple repetitions:** Different spatial configurations
6. **No feedback:** Prevents learning effects
7. **Reference stays constant:** Clean comparison

---

## IMPORTANT NOTES FOR REPLICATION

### Critical Parameters
- Presentation duration MUST be exactly 200ms
- Dot spacing minimum 42 pixels (prevents crowding)
- Lines must not cross each other
- Lines >12 pixels from dots (except connecting lines)
- Always 4 total lines per pattern

### Timing Precision
The 200ms presentation is critical - if too long, participants might count. 
If too short, they might not perceive the patterns clearly. Use proper 
timing validation in Expyriment.

### Stimulus Generation
Pre-generate all stimuli before the experiment starts. Generation with 
all constraints can take time and shouldn't happen during the experiment.

### Participant Instructions
Make clear that:
- They should keep eyes on center fixation cross
- They judge which side has MORE dots (not estimate exact numbers)
- There's no time limit for response
- No feedback will be given
- Accuracy is more important than speed
